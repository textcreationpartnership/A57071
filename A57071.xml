         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any reaſons have at laſt induced me to preſent the world with this ſmall Tract of my many years ſtudy and practice in the Art and Myſterie of Cookery.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In that I was brought up in the Family of an honourable Lady, who ſpared for no coſt nor charge, for my inſtruction in the ſaid Art, not only at home in her houſe, but alſo abroad in the late Kings Court, of ever bleſſed memory, and in the houſes of certain honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and at the entertainment of Embaſſadors, beſides many other Feaſts: Since which time, I have ſerved as Maſter Cook to many honourable Families before and ſince the wars began, both in this my Native Countrey,
<pb facs="tcp:61353:4"/>
and with Embaſſadors and other Nobles in certain for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign parts: Thus having through Traditions and my conſtant practical experience in this the long progreſs of my life, received knowledge herein, and conſidering the world is a body, and every individual and rational ſoul a member thereof, and that man was not born for himſelf, but for the good of the whole, it is but juſt to pay tribute unto her, from whom I received all, which I do account but a very ſmall compenſation, to return this my mite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame treaſury from whence I firſt received it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It hath been the practice of moſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous men of all Arts and Sciences, to hold forth to Poſterity, what light or knowledge they underſtood to be obſcure in their ſaid Art: And the wiſeſt of Philoſphers, learned and pious men of old, have highly extolled theſe principles, who went not out like the ſnuff of a candle, but have left their Volumes to after-ages, to be their School-maſter in what they have a mind to practiſe, which calls back time, and gives life to the dead.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I was further encouraged to this work, by ſeeing that happy and bleſſed reſtauration of our long-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Royal Luminaries; and the hopes of the benevolent Influence of Liberality and Hoſpitality, which is in part the Life of Arts and Sciences. It is indeed like the Sun in the Firmament, which keeps not his light and heat for himſelf, but in his Gradual revolution, freely beſtows himſelf to the giving of life, feeding and cloathing the whole Univerſe: And doth not his Repreſentation and Production, even our Sun, or King and his Nobles do the like? Do not thouſands live by their benevolence? What have they more then others, but honourable reſpect and attendance? As for food and rayment, they pay for, by which all men live; for all that they have comes to the
<pb facs="tcp:61353:4"/>
Purſe, Pocket, Back and Belly of all men yearly; they are like a great Wheel that moves the next; and ſo they move one the other, that none ſtands idle; the removing of which, is the deſtruction of the whole, which we have lately found by woful experience, occaſioned by <hi>Solomons</hi> fools, even men to whom God hath given riches, ſo that they want nothing for their ſoul of all that they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, yet God giveth them not power to eat thereof, but a ſtranger eateth it, but this hath been their vanity, and their evil diſeaſe; notwithſtanding they had as good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences as <hi>Judas,</hi> who ſaid, Wherefore ſerves this waſte, it might have been ſold for much money and given to the poor.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Being deſired by many young Practitioners in this Art, and others, for Receipts and aſſiſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I was the more willing to preſent theſe my ſmall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to publick view, for the ſatisfaction of all thoſe that are ingenuous, and deſirous to be inſtructed in the ſaid Practice. I do not queſtion but divers Brethren of my own Fraternity may open their mouths againſt me, for publiſhing this Treatiſe, pretending that thereby it may teach every Kitchen-wench, and ſuch as never ſerved their times, and ſo be prejudicial to the Fraternity of Cooks; but theſe are to let them know, the ſame may as truly be ſaid of all other Arts and Sciences, the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Mathematician, Navigator, Phyſitian, Chirurgion, Farryer, and many hundred more. And what Artiſts amongſt them, make not themſelves perfect, as well by ſtudying their Volumes, as by practice. Yet there is an evil amongſt moſt men, when they have learned themſelves by other mens light, they would extinguiſh that light, that none might follow them; and ſo men monopolize all knowledge therein to themſelves, and condemn all
<pb facs="tcp:61353:5"/>
thoſe that are a guide and light to the ignorant; there is none other but ſuch will condemn me in what I have done. Again, they are miſtaken that think a Tract of this kind can be very beneficial unto any, but ſuch as have been in ſome meaſure Practitioners, and underſtand the nature of the ingredients propoſed for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of any one thing; for experience ſhall tell all my Brethren, that it is an hard thing to teach a young Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioner to dreſs many hundred of the ſaid diſhes, after the compoſition is made; nay, although they look on them, and give them direction, yet will they ſpoyl it in the doing, therefore I hope it will anſwer my end and no more; which is for the inſtruction of young Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, that give their minds to the ſtudy thereof; and to the end that it may, I here preſent unto the Reader this ſmall Tract in a methodicall form, as Cookery lyes in its order and workmanſhip, containing in the firſt part thereof fifteen Books, the firſt ſix of which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Cookery in its preparations to Feaſts or Common Diets, and that in regard they are to be performed Moneths, Weeks, or Dayes before-hand, for the greateſt part thereof; the firſt contains Pickles, the ſecond how to ſowce, pickle, and coller all manner of fiſh; ſo through all your preparations of cold meats of all kinds, Jelly, Leaches, Creams, and many other uſeful and necſſary things for your Feaſt on all occaſions; and in the ſeventh Book you begin to ſee your Cookery in its heat, running through all the reſt of the Books in all kinds of Cookery, in a methodical manner. I have alſo for thy further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction compoſed certain Bills of Fare for the four ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and a ſecond Book, called, Rare receipts in Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, with ſome uſeful old Traditions and new Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which will be very neceſſary and advantageous for
<pb facs="tcp:61353:5"/>
the Fraternity of Cooks; together with a Book of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, Conſerving and Candying: I would deſire the Reader in all theſe, for his further benefit, to obſerve theſe few particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, that whereas the diſhes of meat may ſeem too big in moſt, or all the Receipts to ſome; that makes no matter to the teaching of them that have occaſion to have them leſs; it is remedied in taking an equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of each ingredient, according to the quantity as you intend to dreſs, whether half, or a quarter, or ſo much as the Receipt. Again, if you would augment, you muſt take a bigger quantity of each ſimple in your general compound.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Salt be left out, where it ought to be, as it is poſſible it may, correct that fault; alſo take out your faggot of ſweet herbs, Onions, Garlick, or whole Spices from your meats, when you go to diſh your meats; for I have omitted to mention this in every Receipt, becauſe once done, will ſerve for all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Reader would take notice, that the ſecond part, called Receipts, was intended to be placed in the firſt part, in order and form, every ſort by it ſelf, as the firſt part is compoſed; but the Author being abſent in the Countrey, that and many things more intended were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: only I deſire the Reader to correct it in his own thoughts, and enlarge it by what is done, until the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gets further opportunity to add thereto.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let not the Reader think that the Bills of Fare be too big, but conſider, if he intends to have fewer diſhes, what an advantage he hath to have his choice out of ſo many.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whereas there are ſome Bills of fleſh, only for fleſh-dayes, and others of fiſh, for fiſh-dayes, in
<pb facs="tcp:61353:6"/>
caſe you would have both fiſh and fleſh, you may make a mixture at your pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Obſerve that ſome things propoſed are not in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the whole Seaſon, or three Moneths, but part thereof; for example, in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April</hi> Oyſters are in ſeaſon, but not in <hi>May;</hi> in which time Trouts and many other ſorts of fiſh and ſome fleſh, as Bucks, are not in ſeaſon, but they are in ſeaſon in <hi>May;</hi> ſo the like in all the other ſeaſons of many things. You muſt correct your Bills of Fare for theſe things, and take that which comes in, for that which went out: So minding the four ſeaſons, the ingenuous Practitioner will be able to make a Bill of Fare of himſelf, without the help of any. I have in the whole matter uſed my uttermoſt endeavour to inſtruct the ingenuous Practitioner. If any thing therein be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or profuſe, I ſhall deſire thy charitable conſtruction thereof; if it be worthy of thy acceptance, it anſwereth my expectation, and will further encourage him to ſerve thee in the like matter, who ſubſcribes himſelf, thine in the Art and Myſterie of Cookery,</p>
